<body >

<p class="dev-content-inner">Below is a list of River See developmental

workshop/experiments Some were open to the

public, some were not. Some included myself and

SEE, some included additional cast members (cast

size varied). Sometimes I composed with the audience

Total rehearsal time varied, from none, to 3

These experiments have provided time, space,

and resource centered on: completing the River

See performance/novel and performance script

(which is excerpted from the performance/novel);

discovering what it means to perform as Composer

in the piece as it unfolds live; devising physical

composition instructions; experimentation with

space/with reconstructing notions of what it means

to make performance using technologies traditional

to people of color; experiencing intersections of art,

healing, science and spiritual practice/based in

language that I can use to communicate
